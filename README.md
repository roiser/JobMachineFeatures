WLCG Job Machine Features Taskforce

Job/Machine Features are a means in the WLCG environment to provide information about the machine and job characteristics available on a given service to the VO payload. This repository is divided into two top level directory trees:

client  : the "mjf.py" client part available to VOs
services: the implementations of the different service provider infrastructures

Each directory contains another README with more instructions for that part of the tree
